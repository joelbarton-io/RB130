| **[00-]** "survey testing suite SLOWLY"           |
1. read prompt; rewrite question/goal of exercise   |
2. read tests; identify edge cases/note class meth  |
3. write explicit reqs; guess at implicit reqs      |
4. read the last few cases closesly                 |

| **[07-]** "solve every step of logic first"       |
1. in -> [...steps...] -> out          [data flo]   |
2. play w/ ds and loose algorithm      [high lvl]   |
3. stuck? solve one example manually   [low  lvl]   |

| **[14-]** "code with intent"                      |
1. step through test-cases in groups                |
2. don't rush into a solution; commit late!         |

  -> look out for class/instance methods in test suite
  -> use pedac liberally; you should have a full hour
