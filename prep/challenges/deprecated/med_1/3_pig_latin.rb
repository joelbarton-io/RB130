# Rule 1: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
# Rule 2: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.


=begin
if beginning sounds like vowel, append 'ay' to ending

if beginning sounds like conso, shift and push to end + 'ay'

=end
